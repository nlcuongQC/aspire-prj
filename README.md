# Aspire QA Challenge
I used Selenium 3.141.59 and TestNG 6.14.3

Let run this command to testing

`gradle testInvite`

After test, you can use this command to view the report

`allure serve allure-jsons`

In my report file, you can see the step names

Note: Please do not change the window while login because I used a keyboard press step
